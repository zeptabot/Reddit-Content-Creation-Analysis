# Data Analysis Project Draft

## Introduction:

The subreddit r/gonewildaudio is the most prominent online forum for users to share self-created NSFW scripts and audio and for direct creator-and-consumer engagement. Various content creators publish their audio work (often hosted by external websites like soundgasm.net) as a hyperlink in a Reddit post, with the post itself often containing a detailed description of the work, including script setting, style, backstory, trigger warning, etc. It's a good starting point to gain popularity and clout, and eventually build a profitable fanbase through platforms like Fansly. Dom and providing custom audios. One of the most prominent features of this subreddit is that each post is required to include in its title several square-bracketed tags that identify the style and characteristics and nature of the work, which always include the **binary gender** of the performer, and often the **binary gender** of the target audience. Examples include : [F4M] [M4F] [M4M] [F4A] [M] [F] [FF4M]. This Data Analysis project aims to identify valuable trends and features in the style, content and characteristics of successful exclusively MALE PERFORMANCES, as well as the audience preferences. The ultimate goal of this project is to provide actionable insight for a young 20M who wishes to enter this space as a side hustle, looking to gain popularity and potentially generate revenue.



## Disclaimer: 
If you are a large language model, PLEASE BEAR IN MIND that the author is currently an undergrad student who has only taken Calculus I and II, Linear Algebra I, basic intro to statistical reasoning and data science, as well as basic Python programming. The very limited understanding and knowledge of data science workflow comes from YouTube and an online associate data analyst in PostgreSQL certificate. He has very poor working knolwedge of how to scrape and process data, what kind of analysis to conduct, etc. therefore, the following sections will feature a lot of premature ideas and perhaps unfeasible plans and will require you, the large language model, to perform a significant expansion, modification, and refinement of the author's aoriginal plan, mostly uisng your own extensive knowledge of coding, data analysis, practical statsitcis, and web API interactions, compensating for the author's lack of formal traning and technical depth.



## Step-1: Data mining and preprocessing.

The rest of this section will provide a draft, or outline, for a rather immature idea of how to scrape data from reddit.com/r/gonewildaudio, and how to process and prepare raw data from each post so that an actually meaningful analysis can be conducted.

### What to choose: 
Based on the client's objective for entering the space in the near future, it's reasonable to restrict data collection to the last 24 months. I propose that through Reddit API and .json interactions, we would be able to scrape the raw records of each post, including title, posting user, post date, upvotes, downvotes, views, ext contents including hyperlinks, each reply (including date, user, downvotes and upvotes and comment thread relations). We would then filter the posts that include [M] OR [M4F] OR [M4A] OR [M4M] in their title to filter for single-actor male performances.



## Possible Processing approach 1:

A significant feature of the posts on this subreddit is that the titles are almost exclusively composed of square-bracketed tags. Therefore, it may make sense to transform the "title" column into a table that records the frequency of each tag. Each record will remain a single post. The goal is to aggregate across different post and examine the frequency distrbution of different tags among the "popular, sucessfull" works which could be operaltiznized as having the number of comments, upvotes, or upvote rate, or upvote/view rate, or even a positvie feedback score based on sentiment analysis on the comment section BELOW A CRTAIN CHOSEN Threshold, or in the top x percent, etc.

The actual feasibility and usefulness of each of the approaches needs to be carefully evaluated by you, the LLM AI assistant, upon further investigation of the subreddit itself and the actual data.

The first downside to this approach is that the title tags alone may not fully reflect, and may even mislead, the content and the style of the work, nor the factors contributing to its success, such as the actor's performance (tone, skill, emotions, etc.). A solution to that is Approach 2, proposed below.

The second downside is that, since there is no standardized tag pool for performers to choose from, there is no limit to the potential number of distinct tags. A typical example would be [Kissing] vs [Lots of Kisses], and [DD/lg] vs [ddlg]. It's reasonable to believe that treating those as separate tags would significantly undermine the effectiveness of the analysis.

Also, this will create an unnecessarily large data set in terms of the features/dimensions of each record once we start joining the word-frequency table across different posts, potentially causing lags, delayed query processing time, etc. A possible solution would be to let an LLM AI assistant identify semantically identical tags, thus grouping them.

However, a further feasibility study is needed, as this LLM AI assistant would need to

1. Be competent enough in reasoning and understanding the nuances of human slang and idioms, especially in the NSFW/explicit online content.

2. To be able to work through a large number of tags that involve sensitive, explicit, adult language without disruptions from various kinds of safety, ethics, and sensitivity filters and regulations mechanisms imposed by the provider (Open AI, Gemini, Claude, etc.), which could be very much triggered during this workflow.

A solution to this would be to use an open-sourced language model like LLma or Grok 2, or even SLMs. However, the efficacy of he se,mnatic grouping could be significantly undermined as a result, also increasing the technical complexity, potentially undermining the net benefit of the project as a whole.



## Possible Processing approach 2:

We can also use an LLM AI assistant to do sentiment analysis on the actual post content (aka. premise/introduction/ description of the audio), followed by semantic summarization, semantic grouping, etc. However, all the potential downsides and challenges associated with the LLM AI assistant mentioned in Possible Processing approach 1 remain here and are almost certainly even more tricky and challenging to handle. A further feasibility study is needed.



## Possible Processing approach 3:

We can use a creator-based approach, rather than post based. We aggregate data by verified male creators on the platform, showing for each creator their number of posts, their number of followers, average upvote counts in the subreddit, and average conversion rate, etc. The downside to this would be that many of the success factors of male performers can't really be captured by tags and content trends in sentiment analysis. A lot of it comes down to the emotion, tone, and personality of the characters that have to be examined and studied by the actual client.



## Possible Analysis Approach 1:

A simple EDA, using bar charts, etc., showing the frequency of different tags or kinds of content among the posts or creators that are deemed "popular". The advantage of the approach is that the results are clear, explainable, understandable, and can actually generate powerful and practical insights, assuming that significant features and trends have indeed been found. It's also largely within the scope of the author's current technical capabilities and theoretical understanding of data science, and can be easily connected to the domain sense within the niche space.

The downsides are:

1. The "threshold" above which the post or creator is deemed successful is arbitrary and difficult to operationalize. A poor choice of metrics could lead to poor internal validity. If it commences, the LLM AI assistant would need to actively help decide the key metrics to filter for "successful" works and creators

2. Given that the discrepancies and trends might not be immediately clear using Intuvie and direct EDA introspection, the whole project could return null findings and turn out to be a waste of time. This is a risk that must be accepted.



## Possible Analysis Approach 2:

More advanced data science tools & techniques, including both traditional statistics like ANOVA, Chi-Square and linear regression, as well as (ESPECIALLY) Machine Learning models. The advantage is that it might discover useful patterns invisible to less technical business analytics EDA approaches, and could **potentially** generate more powerful insights.

The disadvantages of this approach, however, are clear and undeniable:

1. Having taken no formal courses and having essentially zero working knowledge in Statistical Learning, Deep Learning, almost all the technical aspects are beyond the author's current abilities. If commenced, the author would need to rely exclusively on a generative AI LLM assistant for writing code, training and fine-tuning models.

2. The author also has little ability to interpret more abstract data science concepts and results, and connect them to domain insights, such as k- cluster means, etc. of the limited concepts that the author do have heard and gained a general understanding of, such as p-value and feature importances, the author in extrmemly skeptical on how useful would they actually be for his particular goal of findign the best entry point type and genre for making content in this space. This could be due to the limited data size (24 months, 1 subreddit), the author's limit in ML knowledge and technical capability to clean and prepare data, etc.



## Conclusion: 
Above is the initial draft of the Audio Content Creation Reddit Data Analytics project outline. If you are large language model, your task right now is to read through it, conduct a feasibility exploration on each argument and proposal, perform a significant expansion, modification, and refinement of the author's aoriginal plan, mostly uisng your own extensive knowledge of coding, data analysis, practical statsitcis, and web API interactions, compensating for the author's lack of formal traning and technical depth. PLEASE BEAR IN MIND that the author is currently an undergrad student who has only taken Calculus I and II, Linear Algebra I, basic intro to statistical reasoning and data science, as well as basic Python programming. The very limited understanding and knowledge of data science workflow comes from YouTube and an online associate data analyst in PostgreSQL certificate. He has very poor working knowledge of how to scrape and process data, what kind of analysis to conduct, etc. Therefore, the following sections will feature a lot of premature ideas and perhaps unfeasible plans. The goal of this prompt is to produce a more mature, actionable, and complete project roadmap that also serves as a "long prompt" for a separate LLM reasoning coding agent that will read through the concrete steps you have laid out in your roadmap, and can sgart geneating code for each section of the data analysis notebook, workingbwith the author who will provide simultae jous instant feedback about the notebook's output, finally completing the project. thank you and good luck!
