# Reddit Audio Content Analysis - Refined Project Roadmap

## Project Overview
**Objective**: Analyze r/gonewildaudio to identify success patterns for male performers, providing actionable insights for market entry strategy.

**Target Audience**: Undergraduate with basic Python/statistics background seeking practical business insights.

## Phase 1: Data Collection Strategy

### 1.1 Reddit Data Access (Recommended Approach)
**Use Pushshift/Academic Torrents instead of Reddit API**
- Reddit API has severe rate limits (100 requests/minute) and recent restrictions
- Pushshift archives provide historical data without API limitations
- Alternative: Use `praw` (Python Reddit API Wrapper) for smaller, recent datasets

### 1.2 Data Collection Scope
**Timeline**: Last 12 months (more manageable than 24)
**Filters**: Posts containing tags [M], [M4F], [M4A], [M4M]
**Data Points to Collect**:
- Post metadata: title, author, timestamp, score (upvotes-downvotes)
- Engagement: num_comments, upvote_ratio
- Post content/description
- Author information (if available)

### 1.3 Technical Implementation
```python
# Primary libraries needed
import praw  # Reddit API
import pandas as pd
import re  # Regular expressions for tag extraction
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```

## Phase 2: Data Preprocessing (Simplified Approach)

### 2.1 Tag Extraction and Standardization
**Strategy**: Focus on most common tags rather than trying to capture everything
- Extract all bracketed tags using regex: `\[([^\]]+)\]`
- Create frequency distribution of all tags
- Manually group the top 50-100 most common tags into categories
- Ignore rare tags (appearing <10 times) to reduce dimensionality

**Tag Categories to Create**:
- Gender tags: M, M4F, M4A, M4M
- Content type: Script Fill, Improv, Ramblefap
- Tone/Style: Gentle, Rough, Romantic, Dom, Sub
- Setting: Boyfriend, Stranger, Fantasy
- Special elements: Accent, Binaural, etc.

### 2.2 Success Metrics Definition
**Primary Success Metric**: Engagement Score
```
Engagement Score = (upvotes * 0.7) + (comments * 0.3)
```
**Success Threshold**: Top 25% of posts by engagement score

**Secondary Metrics**:
- Upvote ratio (>0.85 = well-received)
- Comments per upvote ratio (indicates engagement quality)

### 2.3 Data Cleaning Steps
1. Remove deleted posts and accounts
2. Filter for posts with >10 upvotes (minimum visibility)
3. Handle missing data appropriately
4. Create binary success variable (successful vs. not successful)

## Phase 3: Analysis Strategy (EDA-Focused)

### 3.1 Descriptive Analytics
**Basic Statistics**:
- Distribution of posts by day/time
- Average engagement metrics by tag category
- Success rate by tag combination
- Creator posting frequency vs. success

**Visualizations**:
- Bar charts: Most common tags in successful posts
- Heatmap: Tag co-occurrence matrix for successful posts
- Time series: Posting patterns of successful content
- Box plots: Engagement distribution by major tag categories

### 3.2 Comparative Analysis
**Successful vs. Unsuccessful Posts**:
- Tag frequency comparison
- Content length analysis (description word count)
- Posting time analysis
- Title structure patterns

### 3.3 Advanced Analysis (Optional)
**If basic analysis shows clear patterns**:
- Chi-square tests for tag independence
- Simple logistic regression (success ~ top_tags)
- Correlation analysis between posting behavior and success

## Phase 4: Insight Generation and Recommendations

### 4.1 Content Strategy Insights
**Questions to Answer**:
- What are the most successful tag combinations?
- What content styles show highest engagement?
- When is the best time to post?
- How does posting frequency affect success?

### 4.2 Market Entry Recommendations
**Deliverable Format**:
- Top 5 recommended content types for new creators
- Optimal posting schedule
- Essential vs. optional tags to include
- Content description best practices

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1-2: Setup and Data Collection
- Set up Python environment
- Collect and store raw data
- Initial data exploration

### Week 3: Data Preprocessing
- Extract and categorize tags
- Calculate success metrics
- Clean and prepare dataset

### Week 4: Analysis and Visualization
- Conduct EDA
- Create visualizations
- Statistical testing (if applicable)

### Week 5: Insights and Documentation
- Synthesize findings
- Create final report
- Develop recommendations

## Technical Requirements and Limitations

### Required Skills (Within Your Level)
- Basic Python programming
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization
- Basic statistical concepts

### Potential Challenges and Solutions
**Challenge 1**: Reddit API limitations
**Solution**: Use pre-collected datasets or academic access

**Challenge 2**: Content sensitivity for NLP
**Solution**: Focus on tags and metadata, minimize text analysis

**Challenge 3**: Tag standardization complexity
**Solution**: Manual grouping of top tags only, ignore long tail

**Challenge 4**: Statistical interpretation
**Solution**: Focus on descriptive statistics and clear visualizations

## Success Criteria

### Minimum Viable Analysis
- Successfully collect 1000+ relevant posts
- Identify top 20 most common tags in successful content
- Create 5-10 clear visualizations showing patterns
- Generate 3-5 actionable recommendations

### Stretch Goals
- Identify optimal tag combinations
- Develop posting time recommendations
- Creator behavior analysis
- Simple predictive model for post success

## Risk Mitigation

### Data Access Issues
- Have backup data sources ready
- Start with smaller dataset for testing
- Consider web scraping as last resort

### Analysis Complexity
- Keep analysis simple and interpretable
- Focus on business insights over statistical sophistication
- Document all assumptions and limitations

### Time Management
- Set weekly milestones
- Prioritize core analysis over advanced features
- Plan for iteration and refinement

## Deliverables

1. **Jupyter Notebook**: Complete analysis with code and visualizations
2. **Executive Summary**: 2-page insights and recommendations
3. **Data Dashboard**: Simple visualizations of key metrics
4. **Documentation**: Methodology and limitations
